# Project 4: Open Space

## Stage 3/5: One small step for man...

## Description
You have a control deck, but it looks a bit simplistic, so let's work on the looks!

You are free to start from one of the two separate parts of the stage: customizing the input elements or creating a border for the panel.

To create a multicolor border, we wrapped all the content of the control-panel element just like in the scheme below and set the gradient background to the outer element:

There is just so much to do when it comes to decorating: you can create a whole variety of visual effects by setting gradients; if you are interested, check out Lea Verou's patterns gallery. We decided to make a simple warning border, but you can implement a different theme.

It's important for a web developer to know how to customize standard HTML elements: you don't want to create something that looks like a website from the very first days of the Internet. Customize the password field, the password submission button, and the rocket launch button.

For testing purposes, we listed several crucial points in the objectives, but you can add whatever you want, for example, change the font or the text color, set a border, etc.

Last but not least, don't forget to set the margins to make your panel nice and neat.

## Objectives
1. Move the contents of the element with the class control-panel to a new element with the class control-panel__inner.
2. Set a gradient background to the control panel.
3. Change the text and the border of the password field.
4. Change the background color of the "ok" and "launch" buttons.
5. Change the shape of the "launch" button.
