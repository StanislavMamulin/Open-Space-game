# Project 4: Open Space

## Stage 2/5: Launchpad

## Description
Well done: the setup looks fantastic! Now, it's time to build the control deck for our rocket.

We suggest taking some safety precautions, specifically, make a control panel that is protected by a password. The panel should contain two blocks of controllers and a big launch button. In this project, the controllers won't actually change the trajectory of the rocket, but after completing all the stages, you can easily customize the function of these controls if you wish.

Let's start by implementing the HTML part according to the suggested scheme:

Note that each element with a border is \<input/\>. Also, remember that there are several different types of inputs: your choice should be based on the resulting page example we provided below.

Position your panel and set the background color: it can be any color you like.

Now, position the elements for the rocket engine management. Use your expertise and experience from the first stage to make the ranges vertical. Put the elements in place by setting the flex property.

## Objectives
1. Implement the given scheme using the appropriate types of input fields.
1. Set the background to the panel.
1. Inputs in the sections "check-buttons" and "levers" should be positioned.
1. Each lever should be vertical.
