# Project 4: Open Space

## Stage 4/5: X-files

## Description
Good job! All the design work is pretty much over, and now it's time to switch to JS.

Safety first: obviously, only certain people can have access to the launch panel. Your goal is to make all inputs disabled unless the correct password has been entered. You should implement the function that checks the entered password against the real one and enables all inputs if they match. The function should be called after the user presses the "ok" button.

Okay, now we'll tell you the password! Keep it secret and don't tell anyone: the password is TrustNo1.

## Objectives
1. All the inputs except the password field and the "ok" button should be disabled.
2. All the inputs except the password field and the "ok" button should be enabled after the correct password (TrustNo1) has been entered.
